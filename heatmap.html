    <h3>What is a HeatMap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Heat Maps are graphical representations of data that utilize color-coded systems</li><br>
      <li>The primary purpose of Heat Maps is to better visualize the volume of locations/events within a dataset and assist in directing viewers towards areas on data visualizations that matter most</li><br><br>
      <li class="c1">But they are much more than that. What many people dont realize, is that Heat Maps can be applied to a handful of data visualizations. Because of their reliance on color to communicate values</li><br>
      <li class="c1">Heat Maps are perhaps most commonly used to display a more generalized view of numeric values. This is especially true when dealing with large volumes of data, as colors are easier to distinguish and make sense of than raw numbers. However, Heat Maps are multifaceted and can also be used in more literal senses, for example, to showcase ‘hot and cold’ (density) zones on a map</li><br>
